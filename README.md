# CAPS-AI-Network-bot
## Project Description 
### What it does
It guides the user around the CAPS Colab Network website for new teachers and students.
### Inspiration
Mr. Mohn came to us with a project idea that would help the CAPS Network website.
### How we built it
We used chatbase.co in order to create the bot and train it, but we still need to keep retraining it on more information.
## How to use it
Copy and paste the link into you browser and then ask some questions about the Caps Colab Website.
